sampling factory is a loop sampler where you load a sample like a percussive sound, 
synthesizer sample, drum loops..

effect are all unique and made from scratch

loop everything to create new sounds

start by launch with opening the samplingfactory.exe

click on the disk to open a file

set the loop start and loop end 

increase the master volume and adjust general volume and the 5 audio chanel

connect your xbox/playsation controller with bluetooth and play with it

experiment different speed for each audio channel

delay effect can reduce volume so when delay used increase the volume

no recording button for the moment but you can route it to your daw with vb-audio cable

be careful this software is experimental and can produce high volume sound that can blow up your speaker, your house and anything around, the neighbor can get pretty mad at it, maybe they will call the cops to get you in trouble for using the coolest software ever.

stay fresh!
